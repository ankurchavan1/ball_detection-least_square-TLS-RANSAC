Project Description:
This problem 1 of the project detects the motion of a red ball in a video recording and predicts the trajectory of the ball.
Problem 2 involves principal compenent analysis of spatial Lidar data and implementation of estimation algorithms like Least squares,
Total least squares and RANSAC from scratch.

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook in the Anaconda environment. 
The following libraries are used:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
cv2

The project consists of a report in PDF format and a separate code file. 
The report provides a detailed explanation of the approach, results, and conclusions. The code file contains the Python code used to perform the analysis.

Instructions
To run the code, follow these instructions:

Install Anaconda and create a new environment
Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the folder containing the code file
Open the code file in Jupyter Notebook
Place the following files in the same folder as the code file:

ball.mov
pc1.csv
pc2.csv
Run the code file in Jupyter Notebook

Results
The red ball is detected frame by frame using OpenCV and the trajectory is estimated bu curve fitting.
Estmation Algorithms is implemented on a Lidar data from scratch.
