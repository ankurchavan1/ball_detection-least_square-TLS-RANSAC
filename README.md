Project Description
This project consists of two problems:

Detecting the motion of a red ball in a video recording and predicting its trajectory.
Performing principal component analysis (PCA) on spatial LIDAR data and implementing estimation algorithms such as Least Squares, Total Least Squares, and RANSAC from scratch.
The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook in the Anaconda environment. The following libraries are used:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
cv2
The project includes a report in PDF format and a separate code file. The report provides a detailed explanation of the approach, results, and conclusions for both problems. The code file contains the Python code used to perform the analysis.

Instructions
To run the code, follow these instructions:

Install Anaconda and create a new environment

Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the folder containing the code file

Open the code file in Jupyter Notebook

Place the following files in the same folder as the code file:

ball.mov
pc1.csv
pc2.csv
Run the code file in Jupyter Notebook

Results
For problem 1, the red ball is detected frame by frame using OpenCV, and the trajectory is estimated by curve fitting. For problem 2, the PCA analysis reveals the major modes of variation in the LIDAR data, and the estimation algorithms are implemented from scratch to extract the optimal solutions for the data.

The report provides a detailed discussion of the results and their implications for both problems.

Conclusion
The project demonstrates the power of computer vision and estimation algorithms in solving complex problems in engineering and science. The approaches used in this project can be applied to a wide range of systems, from ballistics to robotics to autonomous vehicles. The project highlights the importance of understanding the underlying dynamics of a system and using data-driven approaches to extract meaningful insights from the data.
